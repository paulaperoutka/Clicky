# MINION-CLICK
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Motivation
A starter app for learning how to update and persist data using react.js and components.  

## React
This app was built using react.js and deployed through Heroku. 

## Instructions
Minion-click renders different images of minions which listen for click events. 
On user click, a score component tracks, persists, and updates the user's score as well.  User clicks trigger incrementing score when an image is clicked only for the first time. The user's score resets to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once.  The highest score is reset only when bested. 
In addition, each time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts with score zero but persisting the highest score recorded.

## Deplyment
